We will use three types of template files as practice :
1. V6_example = this is an imaginary template not conatining real information 
2. V6_example_1_real = this is a containing real information already present in the DB
3. PII2T_OTS_CB_5mgmL_(speed)_70C_pair_air_AT.xlsx from the PII2T templates from the diao lab

We will use these as practice to add OFETs with new materials and also use a template containing data already present to check for duplicates

To do : 


Task 1 : Read and Extract Data from sheets in template 

- Read the completed template using the data insertion functions and store information as a dictionary- Done by Aaron 

Task 2 : Transferring information from appropriate tables in data base

1. Checking and Storing Experiment Information

	- Extract table information for EXPERIMENT_INFO from template's "Data Origin" sheet

	- Query check if an experiment already exists with the given information: citation_type, metadata

		if yes: assign sample -> exp_id = the existing exp_id
		if no: Insert new experiment into EXPERIMENT_INFO and assign new exp_id 

	- Use Doi function to generate meta data for experiments from literature

2. Checking and Storing Solution Information 

	- Extract table information for all SOLUTION tables (POLYMER, SOLVENT, POLYMER_MAKEUP, SOLVENT_MAKEUP) from template's "Solution_Makeup" sheet

	- Query check if the solvent/s already exists in the SOLVENT table with the given information: pubchem_cid, iupac_name

		if yes: assign solvent_id in SOLVENT_MAKEUP -> the existing solvents pubchem_id
		if no: add new solvent to table and assign solvent_id in SOLVENT_MAKEUP as the new solvents pubchem_id 

	- Query check if the polymer/s already exists with the given information: common_name, iupac_name, mw, mn, dispersity, meta

		if yes: assign polymer_id in POLYMER_MAKEUP -> the existing polymers polymer_id
		if no: Insert new polymer into POLYMER table and assign new polymer_id

	- add wt_frac and vol_frac to POLYMER_MAKEUP and SOLVENT_MAKEUP
	- add concentration to SOLUTION table
	- how to generate SOLUTION_ID ??

	** If solution and exp_info match, then assign existing solution_id. If not, then add a new solution with the solution details

        - Store the solution_id in OFET_PROCESS

3. Checking and Storing Device Information

	-  Extract device geometry for DEVICE_FABRICATION table from "Device Fabrication" sheet

	- Query check if the device geometry already exists in the DEVICE_SUBSTRATE table with the given information: parameters, meta

		if yes: assign device_id in OFET_PROCESS -> the existing devices device_substrate_id
		if no: add new device geometry to DEVICE_SUBSTRATE table and assign device_substrate_id in OFET_PROCESS as the new device_substrate_id

4. Checking and Storing Film Deposition Information 

	- Extract film deposition information for FILM_DEPOSITION table from "Coating Process" sheet

	- Query check if the film deposition information already exists in the FILM_DEPOSITION table with the given information: deposition_type, params, meta

		if yes: assign film_deposition_id in OFET_PROCESS -> the existing film_deposition_id
		if no: add new film deposition information to FILM_DEPOSITION table and assign film_deposition_id in OFET_PROCESS as the new film_deposition_id

5. Extract the various subprocess recipes for SOLUTION_TREATMENT, SUBSTRATE_PRETREAT, POST_PROCESS tables from "Solution Treatment", "Substrate Pretreat" and "Post Processing" sheets. These _ids can match perfectly to previous recipes. If recipe match, use id. If not, add new.

	** showing an example for solution treatment but repeat similarly for substrate treatment and post processing
	
	- Extract solution treatment information for SOLUTION_TREATMENT_STEP table from "Solution Treatment" sheet
	
	- Query check if the solution treatment information already exists in the SOLUTION_TREATMENT_STEP table with the given information: treatment_type, params, meta

		if yes: assign solution_treatment_step_id in SOLUTION_TREATMENT_ORDER -> the existing solution_treatment_step_id
		if no: add new solution_treatment_step information to SOLUTION_TREATMENT_STEP table and assign solution_treatment_step_id in SOLUTION_TREATMENT_ORDER as the new solution_treatment_step_id

	- Question : how to generate solution_treatment_id using solution_treatment_step_id and process_order?

6. Compare process with all sub_process _ids. If match, then use matched process id. Else, make new process_id

7. Insert into SAMPLE

`INSERT INTO sample VALUES (...)`

8. For every characterization item, make a new measurement_id, with the sample_id saved from before. 

	- Add device data
	- Add characterization data
