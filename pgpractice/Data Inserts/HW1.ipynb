    "3. Perform uploads of NEW data on the existing database you just created. Foreign keys should be accurate as new solutions are added. If a solution record already exists, then decide whether it should be updated, or ignored. If the new solution was made with a solvent that was not there before, it should be able to add a new solvent to the SOLVENT table. Same with POLYMER.\n",
