If the solvent does not exist, get the PubChem CID using an API, add it to the `solvent` table, and retry the add. Normally, I would also ask you do this with polymers; i.e., if the polymer does not exist, similarly add new information to the `polymer` table, then retry the add -- but for now let's try the exercise with solvent only. You can assume he only experimented on existing polymers.\n",

    "You may have seen that a lot of these queries can be challenging to program using just psycopg2. Many online articles and tutorials recommend the use of SQLAlchemy to facilitate the generation of queries, and many Python users prefer it because it \"requires little knowledge of SQL\". Your bonus assignment is to test this theory by exploring SQLAlchemy on your own. For example, can you perform all of the questions in this homework with the help of an SQLAlchemy connection to your database? You are a superstar if you do this entire exercise with SQLAlchemy, and you'll be on your way to helping develop OFETdb. But for starters, try the first few problems.\n",
