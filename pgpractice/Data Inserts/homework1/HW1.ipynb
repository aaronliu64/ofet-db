Recently, Jason has only been interested in testing the solubility of single polymers in solution. In his digital lab notebook, he has written down the date he made the solution, the concentration of the solution, and what polymer and solvent he used. Usually, Jason was a good student and wrote down the batch information (molecular weights, dispersity) of the polymer, but sometimes he was an idiot and forgot.

    "You may have seen that a lot of these queries can be challenging to program using just psycopg2. Many online articles and tutorials recommend the use of SQLAlchemy to facilitate the generation of queries, and many Python users prefer it because it \"requires little knowledge of SQL\". Your bonus assignment is to test this theory by exploring SQLAlchemy on your own. For example, can you perform all of the questions in this homework with the help of an SQLAlchemy connection to your database? You are a superstar if you do this entire exercise with SQLAlchemy, and you'll be on your way to helping develop OFETdb. But for starters, try the first few problems.\n",
