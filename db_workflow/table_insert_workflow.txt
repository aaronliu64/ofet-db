1. Read the completed template using the data insertion functions

2. Extract table information for experiment_info from template's Data Origin sheet

Query check if an experiment already exists with the given information: citation_type, metadata

	if yes: assign sample -> exp_id = the existing exp_id
	if no: Insert new experiment into EXPERIMENT_INFO and assign that exp_id 

3. Extract table information for all solution tables from template's SOLUTION_MAKEUP

If solution and exp_info match, then assign existing solution_id. If not, then add a new solution with the solution details

Store the solution_id

4. Extract device geometry for DEVICE_FABRICATION table

5. Extract film deposition information for FILM_DEPOSITION table

6. Extract the various subprocess recipes for SOLUTION_TREATMENT, SUBSTRATE_PRETREAT, POST_PROCESS tables. These _ids can match perfectly to previous recipes. If recipe match, use id. If not, add new.

7. Compare process with all sub_process _ids. If match, then use matched process id. Else, make new process_id

8. Insert into sample

`INSERT INTO sample VALUES (...)`

9. For every characterization item, make a new measurement_id, with the sample_id saved from before. 

9a. Add device data
9b. Add characterization data
